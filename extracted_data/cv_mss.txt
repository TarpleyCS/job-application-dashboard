Millennium Space Systems Hiring Team
Boulder, CO
March 18, 2025

Dear Millennium Space Systems Hiring Team,
I am writing to express my interest in the Ground Software Integration and Management Engineer position at your Boulder, CO
location. As a software engineer with experience in system architecture design and implementation, I am excited about the
opportunity to support Millennium's ground software and mission control infrastructures.
My professional experience at Mammoth Freighters has equipped me with relevant skills that transfer well to satellite ground
systems. I've designed and implemented software solutions that optimize complex operational systems, created data pipelines,
and built visualization tools that accelerate decision-making processes. My work developing a center-of-gravity calculator
demonstrates my ability to create software that addresses specific operational challenges—a skill I believe would be valuable
when implementing mission data processing applications for your spacecraft systems.
I have extensive experience with many of the technical requirements listed in your job description. I've worked with relational
databases, implemented version control using Git, and developed scripts in Python to automate processes. Additionally, my
experience creating visualization dashboards has given me practical knowledge in deploying software solutions that meet
specific operational needs.
What particularly excites me about this position is the opportunity to work at the intersection of software and space systems,
providing that crucial interface between ground segments, mission operators, and the space vehicle itself. I'm drawn to
Millennium's innovative approach and the chance to contribute to space systems that make a meaningful difference.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background could contribute to
Millennium Space Systems' continued success.
Sincerely,
Alex Tarpley
